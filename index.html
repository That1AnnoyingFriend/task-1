<div class="class"> Jaylah Ji'mya Hickmon, professionally known as Doechii, was born on August 14, 1998, in Tampa, Florida.
    Raised in a Christian household, Doechii's father, known as Snatcha Da Boss, was a rapper who recorded professionally, and her uncle also pursued rapping. 
     Her mother, Celesia Moore, played a significant role in nurturing her creativity, encouraging her involvement in various artistic activities despite financial challenges. 
     During her childhood, Doechii was actively involved in ballet, tap dancing, acting, cheerleading, gymnastics, and soccer. 
     Her passion for the arts led her to attend Howard W. Blake High School, a performing arts school in Tampa, where she further honed her skills. 
     Her father recognized her potential early on, notably during a live audition when she was six years old.     
    These diverse experiences during her formative years contributed to Doechii's unique artistic style and paved the way for her successful career in the music industry.
